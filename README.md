# YOLOv8-Retail-Shelves-Detection

Make sure to read the README.txt if you wish to try it yourself.
I did not provide the YOLOv8 training code or the dataset, keeping them private for now.

GLIMR is my graduation project where I developed a computer vision model using YOLOv8. I manually collected and labeled a dataset with Roboflow, focusing on Egyptian products. As the dataset is specific to local items, it may not be fully accurate for foreign products in uploaded images.
